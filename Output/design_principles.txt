The new reward table prioritizes maintaining high performance mode at all times except when the battery is really low. When connected to AC power, all states are rewarded equally to promote high performance regardless of remaining power or application specifics. The same applies when the device is on battery with more than 20% remaining power. When the battery level is critically low (0-20%), the rewards are adjusted back to encourage power saving to prevent system shutdown. This ensures optimal gaming experience while safeguarding against complete battery drain.
